/**
 * Crossover population using single point crossover
 *
 * Single-point crossover differs from the crossover used in chapter2.
 * Chapter2's version simply selects genes at random from each parent, but in
 * this case we want to select a contiguous region of the chromosome from each
 * parent.
 *
 * For instance, chapter2's version would look like this:
 *
 * Parent1: AAAAAAAAAA Parent2: BBBBBBBBBB Child : AABBAABABA
 *
 * This version, however, might look like this:
 *
 * Parent1: AAAAAAAAAA Parent2: BBBBBBBBBB Child : AAAABBBBBB
 *
 * @param population Population to crossover
 * @return Population The new population
